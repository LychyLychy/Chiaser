# Chiaser
lil audio metadata grabber, made it for source and goldsrc games
i cant really code well sorry

Run it with 2 arguments, the path of the file to extract metadata from, and the path to a csv file to output to

example:

    chiaser.exe d:\folder\hi.wav d:\bruh.csv

heres an implementation if you wanna do all files in a folder on windows:

    forfiles /s /c "cmd /c c:\sumfolder\chiaser.exe @path d:\dumb.csv"
    
dont expect linux support because i cant bother

...

yeah thats all i have to say i guess
